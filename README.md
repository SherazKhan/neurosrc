*Under construction*

In the future, I will better structure and document my code

# neurosrc

This repo contains tools and tutorials that I've developed during my research at UCSD

## spectral

This submodule contains functions for oscillatory coupling and spectral analysis
that I've used to analyse electrocorticography recordings.

* `sim_PACoutput.py` - Comparison of phase-amplitude coupling estimation techniques on simulated data

## Coming soon: Simulated neural networks
